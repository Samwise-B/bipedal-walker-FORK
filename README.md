# Bipedal Robot Walking with Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project involved training a small bipedal robot to learn to walk efficiently in two different environments using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. The main goal was to train an agent capable of walking in both the **BipedalWalker-v3** and the more challenging **BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3** environments, provided by **OpenAI Gym**. The environments simulate a bipedal robot in Box2D physics, requiring the agent to balance, navigate, and walk as efficiently as possible.

## Key Objectives and Steps

1. **Train Agent in Simple Environment (BipedalWalker-v3)**:
   - The agent was trained to consistently achieve a score above 300 in the easy environment.
   - The focus was on achieving **fast convergence** (i.e., training the agent to walk efficiently with the least amount of steps).
   - The model utilized was **TD3-FORK** (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), a state-of-the-art algorithm known for its stability and performance in continuous action spaces.

2. **Transfer to Challenging Environment (BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3)**:
   - After achieving success in the easy version, I transitioned to the much more difficult **BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3** environment, where the terrain is more uneven and challenging, and the robot needs to adapt to more complex dynamics.
   - The agent’s performance in this challenging environment was recorded in a **video** and detailed logs for review.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Convergence Speed**: Minimizing the number of environment steps needed for the agent to learn to walk efficiently.
   - **Final Performance**: The agent had to achieve a score of 300+ in the easy environment and demonstrate adaptability in the hardcore environment.

## Technical Skills Gained

### 1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Techniques**
   - **TD3 Algorithm**: I implemented and fine-tuned the **TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)** algorithm, which is an extension of DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient). TD3 improves stability and performance by using techniques like target policy smoothing, delayed updates, and clipped double Q-learning.
   - **Continuous Action Space**: The **BipedalWalker-v3** and **BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3** environments require the agent to navigate in a **continuous action space**, where the agent selects actions (e.g., joint torques) from a continuous range rather than discrete choices.
   - **Actor-Critic Architecture**: I employed an **actor-critic** approach, where the **actor** determines which actions to take based on the policy, and the **critic** evaluates the chosen actions by estimating the value function.

### 2. **Environment Setup and Simulation**
   - **OpenAI Gym**: I used the **OpenAI Gym** library to access and interact with the **BipedalWalker-v3** and **BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3** environments, which simulate the physics of a bipedal robot in a 2D space. This environment was crucial for training the agent in a realistic, simulated setting.
   - **Box2D Physics**: Leveraging the **Box2D physics engine** allowed me to simulate realistic dynamics, including gravity, friction, and joint mechanics, necessary for training the agent to balance and walk.

### 3. **Model Training and Optimization**
   - **Reward Shaping**: I applied **reward shaping** to incentivize the robot to walk and balance efficiently. Rewards were given for staying upright, moving forward, and performing smooth actions. Penalties were applied for falling or inefficient movements.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: I experimented with various hyperparameters of the TD3 algorithm, including learning rates, batch sizes, and exploration noise. This fine-tuning was necessary to ensure that the agent converged quickly and stably.
   - **Experience Replay**: The TD3 algorithm utilized an **experience replay buffer** to store past interactions and reuse them during training, improving sample efficiency and stabilizing training.

### 4. **Model Evaluation and Performance Analysis**
   - **Training Logs and Visualization**: I maintained detailed logs throughout the training process to track the agent’s progress, including the **score** achieved in the environment, **reward per episode**, and the **agent's actions** at each step.
   - **Convergence Monitoring**: The agent's **learning efficiency** was monitored through graphs plotting the score over time, ensuring the model converged as quickly as possible without unnecessary steps.
   - **Video Recording**: Once the agent was trained to perform well in the easy environment, I recorded its performance in both the easy and hardcore environments in a **video format**, demonstrating how the agent navigated and learned to walk in both settings.

### 5. **Challenges and Problem Solving**
   - **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: A key challenge in reinforcement learning is balancing **exploration** (trying new actions) with **exploitation** (using the learned actions). I used **epsilon-greedy exploration** and added **noise** to the actions to encourage exploration while still allowing the agent to exploit its learned knowledge.
   - **Stability and Convergence**: Deep reinforcement learning models, especially in environments with continuous actions, can suffer from instability. I addressed this by utilizing **target networks**, **delayed updates**, and **gradient clipping** to stabilize training.

### 6. **Transfer Learning to Hardcore Environment**
   - After achieving good results in the easy environment, I transferred the trained agent to the **hardcore environment**. This environment presents more challenging terrain, requiring the agent to adapt to new situations and handle more complex dynamics.
   - I monitored the agent's **performance** in the hardcore environment, making note of how well the agent handled the increased difficulty and whether it maintained stability during training.

## Deliverables

1. **Training Logs**: Detailed logs of the agent's performance during training, including scores, rewards, and learning progress.
2. **Video of Performance**: A video recording of the agent navigating the terrain in both **BipedalWalker-v3** and **BipedalWalkerHardcore-v3**, showcasing its learning process and performance.
3. **Final Model**: A trained TD3 model capable of walking efficiently in both environments.

## Summary
